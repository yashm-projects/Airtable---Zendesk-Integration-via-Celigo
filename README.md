**Note** -
Using Zendesk, Airtable & Celigo trial accounts.
All data being used is dummy data & for my learning purposes.
This project is still in progress, as I will be tweaking the mapping and integrating more platforms

Building out Airtable-Zendesk integration via Celigo.

WHAT?

**The project is in progress. Next up...**
Build a callback step from Zendesk to Airtable to indicate that the ticket was imported successfully, and then trigger a Slack alert from Airtable to the relevant channels/teams.
Use a pre-defined schedule to check new tickets and ultimately use a Webhook to run a flow in real time.
